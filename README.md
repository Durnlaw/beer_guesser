# beer_guesser

Please let me direct you to 3 files:
  tree_beer_guesser.py
  region_list.csv
  open-beer-database (mod).csv
  
The other files here can be viewed as well, but they are incomplete or just me testing other models in a shoehorn fashion. 

Thanks for reviewing and thank you for the patience!
